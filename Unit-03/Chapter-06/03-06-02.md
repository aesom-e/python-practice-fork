# Unit 3 Chapter 6 Question 2 - Enhanced Agent Cipher

Your missions have become more perilous, and the standard Caesar cipher is no longer secure enough. Your agency has developed an enhanced cipher that uses multiple keys in a rotating pattern. You need to update your encryption program to handle this new, more complex method to keep your communications safe from prying eyes.

The new encryption process uses three distinct keys, $K_1$, $K_2$, and $K_3$. These keys are applied sequentially to the alphabetic characters of the message $M$. The first letter is shifted by $K_1$, the second letter by $K_2$, the third letter by $K_3$, the fourth letter by $K_1$ again, and so on. The cycle $K_1, K_2, K_3$ repeats for all letters in the message. Crucially, this key rotation only applies to letters (A-Z and a-z); any non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, or punctuation) are skipped in the key rotation and remain unchanged in the output. The cipher must preserve the original case of each letter and handle wrap-around for both uppercase and lowercase alphabets independently.

## Input Specification
There will be four lines of input.
1.  The first line contains the message $M$ to be encrypted. The message can contain uppercase English letters (A-Z), lowercase English letters (a-z), spaces, digits, and punctuation. The length of the message will be between 1 and 1000 characters, inclusive.
2.  The second line contains an integer $K_1$, the first cipher key.
3.  The third line contains an integer $K_2$, the second cipher key.
4.  The fourth line contains an integer $K_3$, the third cipher key.
Each key ($K_1, K_2, K_3$) will be between $-25$ and $25$, inclusive.

## Output Specification
Output a single line containing the encrypted message. The output message must preserve the original casing of letters and keep all non-alphabetic characters in their original positions.

## Sample Input 1
```
Hello World!
1
2
3
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
Igomq Zptoe!
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
Keys $K_1=1, K_2=2, K_3=3$ cycle through letters only ('H' becomes 'I', 'e' becomes 'g', 'l' becomes 'o', next 'l' becomes 'm'). Non-letters ` !` are unchanged and do not consume a key turn.

## Sample Input 2
```
Cryptography 101: Rule Z?
-1
-2
5
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
Bpdortfpfofd 101: Qsqd X?
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
Keys $K_1=-1, K_2=-2, K_3=5$ cycle through letters, handling negative shifts and wrap-around ('y' becomes 'd', 'Z' becomes 'X'). Non-letters ` 101: ?` are unchanged.

## Sample Input 3
```
Test Case 3.
0
0
0
```

## Output for Sample Input 3
```
Test Case 3.
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 3
Using keys $K_1=0, K_2=0, K_3=0$ results in zero shift for all letters, leaving the message identical to the input.
